# FamilyTracker
Family Tracker is a GPS tracking application. 
I have done this work for my course project and learn a lot when working with Android Studio.
To register your account with Family Tracker, it takes phone number primarily.
For Tracking, add them in the list.
As soon as you hit save, all data will be saved in firebase as parent-child lay-out.
Tracking can be easy here for you.
